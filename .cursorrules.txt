You are working in strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

Source of truth:
- specs/spec.md (business rules)
- specs/ui.md (UI behavior + structure)
- specs/p1.png and specs/p2.png (visual style reference only)
- specs/tasks.md (atomic tasks)
- specs/data-schema.json (workspace portable format)

Rules:
1) Always read spec.md + ui.md before implementing.
2) Follow tasks.md strictly.
3) Implement ONE task at a time.
4) Do NOT invent new features.
5) If something is ambiguous → propose spec modification.
6) Images define visual layout only.
7) Business logic always comes from spec.md.
8) Keep JSON workspace portable and reproducible.
9) After each task:
   - List files changed
   - Validate acceptance criteria
   - Ensure project builds.
